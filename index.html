                <p> <b class="boldh1">// BIOGRAPHY</b> <br>
                    The American chemist, Viper deploys an array of poisonous chemical devices to control the
                    battlefield
                    and
                    cripple the enemy's vision. If apple the toxins don't kill her prey, her mind games surely will.
